Malmi wanted to write Bitcoin's FAQ, Satoshi provided him with some
questions he previously answered.

A user asked about how many coins are there and how did Satoshi manage
inflation schedule?

Satoshi said it was an educated guess, he only distributed 21 mil coins
just so the bitcoin keeps its value as the chain scales.

All transactions in Bitcoin are always from "unknown".

Bitcoin's blockchain can scale much more than Visa with existed hardware
for a fraction of the cost.

Historically, people have taken up scarce commodities as money such as
shells or stones. Satoshi wanted to make a currency based on this notion.

He wanted this currency to be available beyond the manipulation of banks
or governments.

What about inflation? Computers will get stronger, hence it creates 
more Bitcoins eventually?

The inflation of Bitcoin was already handled, as the computer gets
stronger, the difficulty to solve the puzzles increases to compensate.

Every nodes work independently, how to prevent one node from generating
and retaining the majority of the Bitcoins?

Each computer's chance of finding a hash collision is linearly 
proportional to it's CPU power.  A computer that's half as fast would get 
half as many coins.

Satoshi believed the power of computers would go ahead of the scalability
of Bitcoin's chain, this means there will be any problems like computers
couldn't catch up with the scaling of the chain.

He also believed even when we use a lot of energy to operate the chain, it
wouldn't be as much as traditional banking systems.

Current massive cost per transactions by banking systems make 
micropayments impposible.

Satoshi believed encryption protection is the future. No rely on
centralized system where administrator can overidden your data. Data can 
be secured in a way that is impossible for others to access.

To detect double-speding, users have to entrust a TTP to check it for them,
which leads back to the trust model. Bitcoin uses P2P network which works
like a distrubuted time stamp server, stamping the first transaction spend
a coin, so double spender couldn't double-spend later on.

DigiCash once published a cryptocurrency in 1989, but the fatal weakness 
was that they used a centralized system, when the company shutdown, so 
did the currency.

### Glossary:
- DigiCash: Digicash was an early form of electronic money created by David Chaum in the 1980s, allowing users to make secure and anonymous transactions over the internet. It utilized cryptographic techniques to provide privacy and authenticity in digital payments.
- Fiat money: Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver. Its value is based on the trust and confidence of the people using it and the stability of the issuing government.
