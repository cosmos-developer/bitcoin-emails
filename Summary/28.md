Creating a digital currency exchange service to trade bitcoins for euros and other currencies could give bitcoins more liquidity and make them easier to use.

There are two possible exchange mechanisms:

- A website where users can post rates and trade with each other, similar to eBay.
- An automated exchange service that calculates rates and performs transactions automatically.

Morevoer, a specific application, such as a virtual goods market, could help bootstrap the use of bitcoins.
