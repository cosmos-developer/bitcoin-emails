## Number of coins and the value of bitcoins
21 million coins for the whole world, which is picked in the middle, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000

The double-spender would not be able to blast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant getting it, so he has to wait before starting.
